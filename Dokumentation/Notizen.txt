--Steps needed by SDRAM to intitialize
--#1. Power up initialization time taken 200 us, one, either NOP or INHIBIT
-- Command is MUST within this period -- as per specs
--#2. PRECHARGE Command MUST be issued
--#3. 8 AUTO REFRESH cycles MUST be performed
--#4. Mode Register may be programmed now.

--#1). Get the address from up, store the address, Activate the corresponding
--     Row. by providing A0 to A12(which will select the ROW) and BA0, BA1
--     which will select the Coloumn
--
--#2). Wait for trcd = 15 ns  while putting NOP on the command bus
--     provide  A0 through A9, A11 in case of (x4), A0 through A9 in case of
--     (x8) , A0 through A8 in case of (x16). We will use (x8)
--#3). Issue the Coloumn address with the choice of A10 = 0 for Disable Auto
--     Precharge, A10 = 1 for Enable Auto Precharge.We will use Auto Precharge
--     DISABLED But here in case of Burst length = full page we do not need
--     A10 functiionality since it is not used in this cycle.

--Steps needed by SDRAM to Maintain data

--The SDRAM MUST be AUTO REFERESHED every 7.81 us or 7810 ns
--if f is the clock freq, then T = 1/f, so n * 1/F = 7810,so n=7.81*f in MHz
--Here f = 100 MHz, so n = 781. Every 781 clocks, an Auto Ref is needed.
--It may be possible, to apply 8192 Auto refs Once in 64 ms or Once in
--64000 * f in HHz clock cycles, we take f  100 MHz, so every 6400000 clock 
--cycles, we need a burst of 8192 Auto refereshs
